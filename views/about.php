            <p>
                Started in 2010, Mama Fish Restaurant quickly established itself as
                a culinary icon par excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique brand
                of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys
                patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of
                the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what
                will arrive on your plate the next time you visit us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to The Frying Pan, a
                successful chain started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured
                for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.

                    Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking parents. His mother's
                    wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with
                    whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his
                    first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which The
                    Frying Pan became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion
                    cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary
                    connections.

                    farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
                    Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of
                    food sources. As he puts it in his own words,<em>

                    Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO,
                    personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his
                    exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if
                    their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his
                    motto, <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em>
